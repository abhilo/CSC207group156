## Problem Domain
The goal of our group's project is to develop a YouTube to Spotify Playlist Converter. This project will facilitate 
seamless playlist transfers from YouTube to Spotify. As a result, the problem domain primarily involves media streaming 
and playlist management.

## Application Description
For customers who want to transfer their YouTube playlists to Spotify, our program strives to offer a simple and 
effective alternative. The application's fundamental features will consist of:
- **Playlist Retrieval:** Users provide a YouTube playlist URL, and the application will extract the list of songs from that playlist.
- **Spotify Authentication** User account authentication will be used to create playlists on behalf of the user/
- **Spotify Playlist Creation:** Our application will create a new Spotify playlist for the user.
- **Song Retrieval:** Use a song matching algorithm to search and match songs from the YouTube playlist to the Spotify database.
- **Playlist Creation:** Retrieved songs will be added to the newly created Spotify playlist.
